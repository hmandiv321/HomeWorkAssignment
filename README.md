Given UI target: https://wireframe.cc/zENMEV

The goal is, to take phone numbers as input, and apply a list of rules, then returns the resulting list after the rules are applied.

For example, Given the list of 5550123, 2145425, 7064253 and the rule "Does not start with 555", it returns 2145425, 7064253.

The Inputs checks that it looks like a phone number, so not empty, no letters, 7 digits long, and does not contain a "-".

The Rules dropdown has just two options, "Does not start with" and "Does not end with" which takes 3 and 4 number values respectively, and one is be able to add multiple rules.

When the user clicks "Filter List" the results list contains the output, and there are no duplicate numbers listed.
